# Regional vibrancy explorer

## Introduction
This is a repository to replicate and reproduce the analysis results by providing R codes with public datasets. This study seeks to develop a regional vibrancy explorer that allows navigating changes in card transaction records across all regions in South Korea. It (will be) published in the [Journal of the Korean Cartographic Association (https://journal.cartography.or.kr/). This study is a part of [**"Understanding depopulation in South Korea through the lens of the city and with the application of Big data"**](https://github.com/wondolee/depopulation), which seeking tackle the consequences of population decline and demographic ageing in South Korea, particularly in rural and peripheral areas where the population is shrinking. It seeks to demonstrate the causes of population decline in coping with the liveability in the population-shrinking regions through Big data analysis.
