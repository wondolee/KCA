# Regional vibrancy explorer

## Introduction
This is a repository to replicate and reproduce the analysis results by providing R codes with public datasets. This study seeks to develop a regional vibrancy explorer that navigates the change in card transaction records across all regions in South Korea. It (will be) published in the [Journal of the Korean Cartographic Association](https://journal.cartography.or.kr/). This study is a part of [**"Tackling population decline"**]https://sites.google.com/view/wdlee/research/depopulation-area-response-centre), deploying challenges to demographic and socioeconomic inequalities by understanding the regional characteristics with the application of big data, particularly in rural and peripheral areas where the population is shrinking. To this end, this study aims to examine the causes of population decline in coping with the liveability in the population-shrinking regions through Big data analysis.
